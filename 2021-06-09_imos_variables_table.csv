rs_chl,Satellite-derived raster product,daily,mg.m-3,"Remotely sensed chlorophyll-a concentration (OC3 model). Derived from the MODIS Aqua satellite mission. Multi-spectral measurements are used to infer the concentration of chlorophyll-a, most typically due to phytoplankton, present in the water (mg.m-3).",IMOS
rs_current,Composite raster product,daily,ms-1; degrees,"Gridded (adjusted) sea level anomaly (GSLA), surface geostrophic velocity (UCUR,VCUR) for the Australasian region derived from the IMOS Ocean Current project. Two additional variables are calculated: surface current velocity (ms-1) and bearing (degrees).",IMOS
rs_salinity,Satellite-derived raster product,weekly,psu,7-day composite remotely sensed salinity. Derived from the NASA Aquarius satellite mission (psu). ,IMOS
rs_turbidity,Satellite-derived raster product,daily,m-1,"Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K490) indicates the turbidity of the water column (m-1). The value of K490 represents the rate which light at 490 nm is attenuated with depth. For example a K490 of 0.1/meter means that light intensity will be reduced one natural log within 10 meters of water. Thus, for a K490 of 0.1, one attenuation length is 10 meters. Higher K490 value means smaller attenuation depth, and lower clarity of ocean water.",IMOS
rs_npp,Satellite-derived raster product,daily,mgC.m_2.day-1,"Net primary productivity (OC3 model and Eppley-VGPM algorithm). Modelled product used to compute an estimate of the Net Primary Productivity (NPP). The model used is based on the standard vertically generalised production model (VGPM). The VGPM is a ""chlorophyll-based"" model that estimates net primary production from chlorophyll using a temperature-dependent description of chlorophyll-specific photosynthetic efficiency. For the VGPM, net primary production is a function of chlorophyll, available light, and the photosynthetic efficiency. The only difference between the Standard VGPM and the Eppley-VGPM is the temperature-dependent description of photosynthetic efficiencies, with the Eppley approach using an exponential function to account for variation in photosynthetic efficiencies due to photoacclimation.",IMOS
